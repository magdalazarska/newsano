  <content>
    The Aurora is an incredible light show caused by collisions between electrically charged particles 
    released from the sun that enter the earthâ€™s atmosphere and collide with gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.
    The lights are seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres.
